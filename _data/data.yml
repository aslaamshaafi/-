        Following are the few contributions in the company:
          - Develop Zynq architecture based Testing Environment which consists of AXI stream based IP, DMA IP, DDR RAM, UART and Ethernet interface.
          - RTL based design for H.264 video encoder, To this end, H.264 video encoder (profile: BASELINE, Level:3.1) was first simulated in MATLAB and then designed in FPGA. The encoder was tested on CYCLONE-V FPGA connected with PC via Ethernet. The encoded bitstream of our encoder was decoded by the VLC media player, running on PC in real time.
