      company: Ghent University, Belgium
      details: |
        My contributions during the role includes:
          - Impelementation of IEEE 802.15.4 standard compliant SDR with full communication stack, supporting flexible data rate ranging from 31.25kbps to 2Mbps and tunable RF frequency ranging from 70 MHz to 6 GHz. [Click here for more details](https://orca-project.github.io/full_stack_802.15.4_imec/)
          - Impelementation of IEEE 802.15.4 compliant multi-channel virtual transceiver, capable of transmit/receive data on up-to 8 radio channels simultaneously. [Click here for more details](https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/8665483)
          - Implementation of 802.11ax extension for openwifi.[Click here for more details](https://github.com/open-sdr/openwifi)

    - role: Design and Verification Engineer
      time: 2016 - 2017
      company: YONGATEK - Yonga Technology Microelectronics, Turkey
      details: |
        My contributions during the role includes:
          - Develop Zynq architecture based Testing Environment which consists of AXI stream based IP, DMA IP, DDR RAM, UART and Ethernet interface.
          - RTL based design for H.264 video encoder, To this end, H.264 video encoder (profile: BASELINE, Level:3.1) was first simulated in MATLAB and then designed in FPGA. The encoder was tested on CYCLONE-V FPGA connected with PC via Ethernet. The encoded bitstream of our encoder was decoded by the VLC media player, running on PC in real time.
